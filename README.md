# phoenix-mercury-mover

My [Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix/) config.

When I upgraded to macOS Sierra, [MercuryMover](http://www.heliumfoot.com/mercurymover/) stopped working. So I implemented some of its functionalities with Phoenix.

## Presentation

Move and resize windows on your Mac from the keyboard, positioning them precisely where you want.

## Usage

Hit one of the main shortcut keys to activate the **move** or **resize** mode:

1. `shift-ctrl-alt-up` to move the frontmost window

2. `shift-ctrl-alt-right` to resize (from right/down) the frontmost window

A popup shows up that explains which keys to press and what they do.

Additionally you can hit some keys while the popup is shown to move the frontmost window to a preset position and/or size:

- `m` to maximise the window

- `=` to center the window

- `h` to move and resize the window to the left half of the screen

Hit `esc` to dismiss the popup.
